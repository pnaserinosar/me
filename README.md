- 👋  Hi there; I’m Pooya (He/Him/His).
- 👀  I’m interested in Data Data Science, ML Engineer, and AI Engineer roles - especially, those involve the design of solutions for Time Series and Causal Inference questions. My preference is to stay in the Biothechnology or Healthcare industry. 
- 🌱  I’m currently refreshing my ML/DL/MLOps/Software skills, in Python, through [Associate AI Engineer for Data Scientists](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-ai-engineer-for-data-scientists) track on DataCamp.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on Computer Vision, NLP, and LLM projects.
